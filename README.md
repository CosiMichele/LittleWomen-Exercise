Hello folks! If you got here that means you have survived the December 9th-10th Carpentries workshop at the University of Arizona!

Learning Shell, Python and Git can be extremely confusing, and quite overwhelming, therefore be proud of yourself!

## Tying It All Together

This repository's goal is to bring together the materials covered this past couple of days, by using Bash, Git and Python. We are going to use the novel Little Women (`LittleWomen.txt`) from yesterday's `shell-lesson-data` folder in order to reinforce your computational learning experience.

Following, you're going to find instructions which you can follow at your own pace.

## Explanining the Repository

In this repository, you'll find the following structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   <- This file
â”œâ”€â”€ secret-1.zip                <- Compressed file #1
â””â”€â”€ secret-2.zip                <- Compressed file #2
```
Each of the `zip` files should be decompressed in order to finish the exercise ðŸ™‚.

## Instructions

1. Import this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the imported repository to your machine.
3. Navigate to the example folder from yesterday and find `LittleWomen.txt` (located in `shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing/LittleWomen.txt`) and copy it to the newly cloned repository.
4. Decompressing `secret-1.zip`:
     - Using the command line*, find how many times Meg, one of Little Women's main protagonists, gets mentioned. The answer will be the password to opening the file.
5. Decompressing `secret-1.zip` revealed a Jupyter Notebook! Add, commit, and push your changes back to GitHub so that you can run the Jupyter Notebook using Colab.
